About Me

My work focuses on strengthening security across threat detection, incident response, vulnerability management, IAM, GRC, and securing modern cloud environments. I bring strong analytical thinking, curiosity, and a disciplined approach to investigating security activity and understanding its broader business impact. I focus on connecting technical findings to actionable outcomes that improve organizational security posture, particularly within cloud-driven architectures. I am especially interested in how AI and intelligent automation are being integrated across cybersecurity and cloud platforms to enhance detection, response, and governance at scale. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
